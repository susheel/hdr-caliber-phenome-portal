## Portal

The **HDR UK CALIBER Phenotype Portal** is a national online open-access, standards-driven library of complex health and disease characteristics (phenotypes) from diverse health data including unstructured and structured data and data from mobile and wearables. 

The Portal comprises shared tools, methods and citeable/version controlled algorithms including disease definitions and electronic health record (EHR) phenotypes developed, validated and used across the HDR UK community. 

Phenotypes have been extensively validated by generating six layers of evidence: aetiological, prognostic, case-note review, genetic, cross-EHR and cross-country replication (Denaxas et al. published in [Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 2019](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/26/12/1545/5536916)).
